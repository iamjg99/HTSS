# HTSS
The main objective was to create beautiful webpages
with very less effort and having an error free code
which will be automatically generated. This editor
will help many young developers to create webpages
own their own even if they do not have much
knowledge of coding. The most important but not
the least is that this can also be used to learn code.
For example, how the image is being uploaded, how
the links are provided to a webpage.
We used electron.js, node.js, HTML, CSS and
JavaScript to build the connections and plugins for
the HTSS editor.
